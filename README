NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - Make sure no
    Smart::Comments escape into the wild

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.009 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - released October 09, 2016
    as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-NoSmartCommentsTests.

SYNOPSIS

        ; In C<dist.ini>:
        [Test::NoSmartComments]

DESCRIPTION

    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

      xt/release/no-smart-comments.t - test to ensure no Smart::Comments

METHODS

 register_prereqs

    Registers a 'develop' phase requirement for Test::NoSmartComments with
    the Dist::Zilla object.

NOTE

    The name of this plugin has turned out to be somewhat misleading, I'm
    afraid: we don't actually test for the _existance_ of smart comments,
    rather we ensure that Smart::Comment is not used by any file checked.

    module.

    Please note I do not expect to be gittip'ed or flattr'ed for this work,
    rather it is simply a very pleasant surprise. I largely create and
    release works like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable;
    however, don't let that stop you if you feel like it ;)
